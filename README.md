![Auto Accept](autoaccept.png)

🚀 **Automatically accepts Antigravity AI agent steps** so you can work hands-free.

## Features

- **Auto-Accept**: Automatically clicks "Accept" for you.
- **Auto-Start**: Enabled by default for every editor when Antigravity opens.
- **Status Bar Toggle**: Click the status bar to turn on/off.
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Alt+A` (or `Cmd+Alt+A` on Mac).

## Usage Requirement

⚠️ **Important**: To make it work, you must open the **Chat** in the Editor.

You can keep it in the background (tabbed away) or anywhere in your editor groups. It doesn't need to be in focus. **As long as that chat tab is open, the extension will continuously accept steps for you.**
